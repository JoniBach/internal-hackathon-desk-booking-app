# Deskly — a smarter desk booking POC

Built for the Mercator office hackathon. Deskly reimagines desk booking as a
**map-first** experience that knows your team, respects the quiet zone, and
**hands back the desks nobody shows up to**.

## What's in it

- 🗺️ **Map-first booking** — pick a desk on a real floor plan, see who's in and
  where the free seats are at a glance.
- 🧠 **"Find me a desk"** — smart finder that ranks free desks by where your
  team is sitting, the quiet zone, standing desks or dual monitors.
- 🛠️ **Admin floor-plan editor** — drag & resize desks and zones, tag desks,
  mark out a Quiet zone, all saved live.
- ⏱️ **Check-in / auto-release** — reservations you don't check into are handed
  back automatically after an admin-configurable window. No more ghost desks.
- 📊 **Insights** — utilisation, no-show rate, ghost desk-days, a 7-day forecast
  and plain-English recommendations — all computed from check-in data, no AI
  spend.

## Run it locally

Requires **Node 18+** (built on Node 24) and **Docker** (for the local Postgres).

```bash
docker compose up -d        # start local Postgres (matches Neon/Vercel)
cp .env.example .env        # DATABASE_URL + DIRECT_URL — defaults match docker-compose
npm install                 # also runs `prisma generate`
npx prisma migrate deploy   # create the schema
npm run db:seed             # seed Mercator London + ~4 weeks of history
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000
```

> Re-running `npm run db:seed` resets the demo data. The seed uses the wall
> clock so today's "reserved, not yet checked in" desk always has a live
> check-in window.

No Docker? Point `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` in `.env` at any Postgres you
like (a free Neon database works) and skip `docker compose up`.

## Deploy to Vercel

The app is built for Vercel + a serverless Postgres (Neon / Vercel Postgres).

1. **Provision a database.** In the Vercel dashboard: **Storage → Create →
   Postgres** (or create a Neon database and copy its connection strings).
2. **Set environment variables** on the Vercel project (Settings → Environment
   Variables):
   - `DATABASE_URL` — the **pooled** connection string (host contains
     `-pooler`). Used by the app at runtime.
   - `DIRECT_URL` — the **direct** connection string. Used by `prisma migrate`.
3. **Deploy.** Import the repo into Vercel and deploy. The `build` script runs
   `prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && next build`, so the schema is
   created automatically on the first deploy — no manual migration step.
4. **Seed once** (optional, for demo data) against the production database:
   ```bash
   # locally, with the production DIRECT_URL exported:
   DATABASE_URL="<direct-url>" DIRECT_URL="<direct-url>" npm run db:seed
   ```
   Skip this if you'd rather start with an empty office.

## Demo path (5 minutes)

1. **Land** → pick **Alex Rivera**. You're on the floor map.
2. **Find me a desk → Near my team** — watch it pick a free desk next to
   teammates and explain why. Book it.
3. **My bookings** — check in. Then go to **Settings** (switch to the **Dana
   Brooks · Admin** profile from the top-right avatar → home) and set
   **auto-release to 1–2 min**.
4. Leave a reservation un-checked-in → it **auto-releases** and the desk goes
   green again on the map.
5. **Floor plan** (admin) — drag a desk, resize the Quiet zone, save.
6. **Insights** — no-show rate, the reserved-vs-used gap, 7-day forecast and the
   "what the data suggests" recommendations.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Actions) · React 19 · Prisma + PostgreSQL
(local Postgres via Docker, Neon/Vercel Postgres in prod) · Tailwind v4 ·
react-rnd (editor) · Recharts (insights).

## Data model

`Premise → Zone → Bookable`, `Booker`, `Booking` (many-to-many to bookables),
and a singleton `AppSettings` for the auto-release window. See
`prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Branding

Mercator-inspired teal/navy palette lives as CSS variables in
`src/app/globals.css` (`--color-brand`, `--color-ink`, …). Drop in exact brand
hex codes there and the whole app follows.
